Task Creation Functionality:

To implement the task creation functionality, you would need to create a form that allows users to input task information, such as the task name, description, and due date. You would then use JavaScript to capture the form data and create a new task object that represents the user's input. Finally, you would add the new task object to an array of tasks and display the updated list of tasks on the screen.

Task Editing Functionality:

To implement the task editing functionality, you would need to provide a way for users to edit existing tasks. This could be achieved by displaying a form for each task that allows users to modify its properties. When the user submits the form, you would use JavaScript to update the corresponding task object in the array of tasks and update the display.

Task Deletion Functionality:

To implement the task deletion functionality, you would need to provide a way for users to delete tasks. This could be done by adding a delete button next to each task in the list, and using JavaScript to remove the corresponding task object from the array of tasks and update the display when the button is clicked.

Task Filtering Functionality:

To implement the task filtering functionality, you would need to provide a way for users to filter tasks based on criteria such as status (completed/incomplete), due date, or priority. You could do this by adding a form that allows users to select the desired criteria and using JavaScript to filter the array of tasks based on the user's input. The filtered list of tasks would then be displayed on the screen.

In each of these cases, you would need to use JavaScript concepts such as objects, arrays, functions, and event handling to implement the functionality, and interact with the HTML and CSS of the project to display and update information on the screen
